# Skeleton

Skeleton for numerical projects with Python. This skeleton uses [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [pytest](https://pytest.org). Rename the `python_skeleton` subdirectory to your module name.

## Tests

Before being able to run tests, you need to execute
```python
pip install -e .[test] 
```
to editably install the code.
